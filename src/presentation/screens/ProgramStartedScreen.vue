                <span class="pl-5">When</span>
                I started college I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I had my
                major set to general studies and for one of my electives, I
                chose a Computer Science Class. During the class, we learned the
                basics of computer programming using Java. After, about a week
                of this class(which was only two classes of it) I swapped my
                major to Computer Information Systems. The most basic printing
                of a "Hello World" to the command line just blew me away. I
                ended up getting my Associate's in Computer Information Systems.
                Right after graduation, I started applying for jobs in the
                field. At the time I didn't realize I didn't have any real
                experience and I feel like if you don't have the real experience
                you differently need at least a bachelor's to land a job in that
                field. Unfortenly I ended up where I needed to work full time so
                I didn't sign up to continue my education the formal way. After
                a couple of years of manual labor, I forgot about programming. I
                started to see coding boot camps pop up. After they kept popping
                up I pulled out my old java book and started looking through it
                again, and all the excitement of programing came back.

                <span class="pl-5">At</span>
                this point, I contemplated continuing formal education and
                getting my bs degree. The thought of 6 months vs 2plus years
                sold attending a Bootcamp for me. So I did a lot of research on
                Bootcamps and ended up signing up for Thinkful FullStack
                program. The first thing was getting interviewed to see if I
                would be a good fit for the program, and everything went
                smooth(I'm pretty sure they let anyone in because they want your
                money, but it's a great feeling just hearing you get accepted).
                We set up my start time, set me up with a mentor I meet with
                twice a week for an hour, and set up my account. The course
                started by teaching the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript.
                This was exciting because you instantly see your work live on a
                page. Oddly I had the most difficult time with CSS. I have never
                really been an artsy person. I always liked when someone else
                would come up with the look. As long as I had a wireframe and
                color palette, I had no trouble implementing the code. After the
                basics, we started learning a little about bootstrap just enough
                to know how to use it. After that, we jumped straight into using
                React which was amazing coming from vanilla js and HTML. It was
                easy to start using I liked the fact you're js and HTML were all
                right there together. After React we started focusing on the
                backend. We started learning node js. and express using this
                made the frontend come to life because before I only knew static
                code but being able to pull data from an API and into your
                project was amazing. Then the fun began when we started building
                the database we used PostgreSQL, and for the UI we used DBeaver.
                We used Heroku to host the server and database. Then the program
                had us make a couple of projects from scratch using all the
                tools we learned. I learned all the technologies fairly easy,
                then we jumped into learning algorithms this is where I had the
                hardest time because it felt like instead of learning it, the
                speed you were supposed to be done with the section they just
                wanted you to memorize and be done, but if you're not going to
                keep back and looking at that your never going to use it again
                until an interview and at that point, you will have already
                forgotten it. That was pretty much the sum of my Journey in the
                Bootcamp, but I have to give a huge shoutout to my mentor. He
                was with me every step of the way there at every meeting in such
                a great mode, very knowledgeable always had an answer and the
                reason why for my questions(which I thought was amazing). Always
                supportive especially when I got stuck on a question he was
                always just an email away. Honestly, out of the whole course the
                best part had to be being able to pair-program with someone so
                knowledgeable and helpful!

                <span class="pl-5">After,</span>
                many months after thinkful i received a job working for a tech
                company that sold pos(point of sale) systems to dryclearners.
                They interview process was kind of scary the first step was
                sitting down with the owner and the programmer and that went
                amazing. They told be about the business and the programmer had
                questions for me i was able to answer all the question, excpet
                the only one that stands out to me as what is hoisting(moving a
                function, variable, or class to the top of the scope. So you can
                use it before it is declared) i wasn't able to answer so i asked
                question right then and there. After this interview i got a
                phone call from my recuriter while i was still in the parking
                lot and they wanted to set up another interview. So the second
                interveiew is were things went bad. I sat down with the head IT
                guy. he had a little test for me to take all about hardware how
                many ports does this router have, how many address can it have,
                i have never really messed with any hardware at the time except
                building a pc. They only question out of the test i was able to
                get was how do you get your ip address(go to comand line and
                type ipconfig). The test was pretty much the whole interview so
                i left feeling like i let yet another job oppertuinty go.
                However i recievce a phone call a few days later saying they
                really liked you but they are neverous to bring you own bored
                because of the hardware interview, but they lowered the salary
                some if thats acceptable they want you. Of course i accepted i
                have been looking for a job for many month i would honelty have
                taken anthing in the programming field at that point. Working
                there was great everyone was very firendly and knowledgeable me
                and the other programmer started build a web based pos system
                from scarth. Using (Vue, Quasar, Node js, Express, Aws"Cognito,
                dyanmodb, ", mongodb) at the same time the other programer was
                makeing a coustomer portal alowing users to chage their
                information on ther current systems. During that they asked if
                we could make the customer portal into an app aswell for andriod
                and apple. So we discussed a few diffrent option, and decided to
                use flutter to make this happen so we only need one codebase
                using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. As he finished the wasbased
                portion i started learning flutter and createing the apps. From
                there my role was to create and maintain the apps as well as
                work on the pos system. Unfortenly, due to covid the book of
                business rapidly decreased and the business ended up being sold.
                After being there a year and a half i learned many things and
                glad i recievce all the experience of working on a small team so
                i was able to be to use so many diffrent technologies that i
                wouldn't of if i was just doing fontend or a specific role.
                After the comanpy was sold i was laidoff.

                started appying for jobs. Received a few interviews, but still
                no luck. I felt very depressed at the time so i decided i would
                take a good vacation and relax. So coming back from the
                vacation.I started working my old job in consturction to pay
                bills. Still grinding and trying to learn as much as i can and
                still applying for jobs that seem like would be a good fit.
                Thats why i started this blog just to have my hands on some kind
                of code as much as possible. At the time of writing this i still
                haven't received a job and am actively applying so if anyone is
                looking for a dedicated worker feel free to message me!
