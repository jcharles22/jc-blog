                <span class="pl-5">When</span>
                I started college I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I had my
                major set to general studies and for one of my electives, I
                chose a Computer Science Class. During the class, we learned the
                basics of computer programming using Java. After, about a week
                of this class(which was only two classes of it) I swapped my
                major to Computer Information Systems. The most basic printing
                of a "Hello World" to the command line just blew me away. I
                ended up getting my Associate's in Computer Information Systems.
                Right after graduation, I started applying for jobs in the
                field. At the time I didn't realize I didn't have any real
                experience and I feel like if you don't have the real experience
                you differently need at least a bachelor's to land a job in that
                field. Unfortenly I ended up where I needed to work full time so
                I didn't sign up to continue my education the formal way. After
                a couple of years of manual labor, I forgot about programming. I
                started to see coding boot camps pop up. After they kept popping
                up I pulled out my old java book and started looking through it
                again, and all the excitement of programing came back.

                <span class="pl-5">At</span>
                this point, I contemplated continuing formal education and
                getting my bs degree. The thought of 6 months vs 2plus years
                sold attending a Bootcamp for me. So I did a lot of research on
                Bootcamps and ended up signing up for Thinkful FullStack
                program. The first thing was getting interviewed to see if I
                would be a good fit for the program, and everything went
                smooth(I'm pretty sure they let anyone in because they want your
                money, but it's a great feeling just hearing you get accepted).
                We set up my start time, set me up with a mentor I meet with
                twice a week for an hour, and set up my account. The course
                started by teaching the basics of HTML, CSS, and javascript.
                This was exciting because you instantly see your work live on a
                page. Oddly I had the most difficult time with CSS. I have never
                really been an artsy person. I always liked when someone else
                would come up with the look. As long as I had a wireframe and
                color palette, I had no trouble implementing the code. After the
                basics, we started learning a little about bootstrap just enough
                to know how to use it. After that, we jumped straight into using
                React which was amazing coming from vanilla js and HTML. It was
                easy to start using I liked the fact you're js and HTML were all
                right there together. After React we started focusing on the
                backend. We started learning node js. and express using this
                made the frontend come to life because before I only knew static
                code but being able to pull data from an API and into your
                project was amazing. Then the fun began when we started building
                the database we used PostgreSQL, and for the UI we used DBeaver.
                We used Heroku to host the server and database. Then the program
                had us make a couple of projects from scratch using all the
                tools we learned. I learned all the technologies fairly easy,
                then we jumped into learning algorithms this is where I had the
                hardest time because it felt like instead of learning it, the
                speed you were supposed to be done with the section they just
                wanted you to memorize and be done, but if you're not going to
                keep back and looking at that your never going to use it again
                until an interview and at that point, you will have already
                forgotten it. That was pretty much the sum of my Journey in the
                Bootcamp, but I have to give a huge shoutout to my mentor. He
                was with me every step of the way there at every meeting in such
                a great mode, very knowledgeable always had an answer and the
                reason why for my questions(which I thought was amazing). Always
                supportive especially when I got stuck on a question he was
                always just an email away. Honestly, out of the whole course the
                best part had to be being able to pair-program with someone so
                knowledgeable and helpful!

                <span class="pl-5">After,</span>
                many months after Thinkful, I received a job working for a tech
                company that sold pos(point of sale) systems to dry cleaners.
                The interview process was kind of scary. The first step was
                sitting down with the owner and the programmer that part went
                amazing. They told me about the business, and the programmer had
                questions for me. I was able to answer all the questions, except
                the only one that stands out to me as what is hoisting(moving a
                function, variable, or class to the top of the scope. So you can
                use it before it is declared) I wasn't able to answer so I asked
                question right then and there. After this interview, I got a
                phone call from my recruiter while I was still in the parking
                lot. They wanted to set up another interview. So the second
                interview is where things went wrong. I sat down with the head
                IT guy. He had a little test for me to take all about the
                hardware side of things like, how many ports does a router have,
                how many addresses can it have, I have never really messed with
                any hardware at the time except building a pc. The only question
                out of the test I was able to get was how do you get your IP
                address(go to the command line and type ipconfig). The test was
                pretty much the whole interview so I left feeling like I let yet
                another job opportunity go. However, I received a phone call a
                few days later saying they liked you but they are nervous to
                bring you on board because of the hardware interview, but they
                lowered the salary some if that's acceptable they want you. Of
                course, I accepted I have been looking for a job for months I
                would honestly have taken anything in the programming field at
                that point. Working there was great everyone was very friendly
                and knowledgeable me and the other programmer started to build a
                web-based pos system from scratch. Using (Vue, Quasar, Node js,
                Express, Aws"Cognito, dynamo DB, ", MongoDB) at the same time
                the other programer was making a customer portal allowing users
                to change their information on their current systems. During
                that, they asked if we could make the customer portal into an
                app as well for android and apple. So we discussed a few
                different options and decided to use flutter to make this happen
                so we only need one codebase using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase.
                As he finished the web-based portion I started learning flutter
                and creating the apps. From there my role was to create and
                maintain the apps as well as work on the pos system.
                Unfortunately, due to covid the book of business rapidly
                decreased and the company ended up being sold. After being there
                a year and a half I learned many things and glad I received all
                the experience of working on a small team so I was able to be to
                use so many different technologies that I wouldn't of if I was
                just doing frontend or a specific role. After the company was
                sold I was laid-off.

                started applying for jobs again. I received a few interviews,
                but still no luck. I felt very depressed at the time, so I
                decided I would take a good vacation and relax a little before
                continuing the hunt. Coming back from vacation, I started
                working my old job in construction to pay bills. Still grinding
                and trying to learn as much as I can. While still applying for
                jobs that seem like would be a good fit. That's why I started
                this blog, just to have my hands on some kind of code as much as
                possible. At the time of writing this, I still haven't received
                a job and am actively applying. If anyone is looking for a
                dedicated employee, feel free to message me!
