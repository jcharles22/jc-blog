    <h1>How it all began</h1>
  <div>
    When i started college i wasn't sure what i wanted to do so i had my major set to general studies,
    and for one of my electives i chose and Computer Science Class. Where we were learning the basics of computer programming 
    using Java. After, about a week of this class(which was only two classes of it) I swapped my major to computer information systems.
    The most baisc printing a "Hello World" to the comand line just blew me away. I ended up getting my associcates in Computer Information Systems.
    Right after that i stated applying for jobs in the field but, at the time not relizing i didn't really have any experience and 
    I feel like if you don't have real experience you diffently need aleast a bachlors. Unfortenly I ended up where i need to work full time
    and i didnt not sign up to contiune my education the formal way. so after a couple years of manual labor me forgetting about programming.
    I started see coding bootcamps pop up. After looking it over i pulled out my old java book and started looking thorugh it again,
    and all the excitment of programing came back. At this point i contiplated about contiuning a formal education
    and getting my bs degree. The thought of 6 months vs 2 plus years sold going to a bootcamp for me. So i did alot of research of 
    bootcamps and ended up Signing up for Thinkful FullStack program.

    The first thing was getting interviewed to see if i would be a good fit for the program, and everything went smooth(im pretty sure
    they let anyone in becuase they just want your money, but its a great feeling just hearing you get accepted). We set
    up my start time set me up with a mentor who i meet up with twice a week for an hour. The course started off just going thorugh
    the basics of html, css, and javascript. Which was all fun becasue you instaly get to start seeing your work live on a page.
    oldly enough i probably have the hardest time with css tough, because i have never really been an artsie persone and 
    i always liked when someone else would come up with the look. As long as i had a wireframe and  colorplatte picked i could make 
    whatever though. After thoses 3 we started learing a little about boot strap just enough to know how to use. After that we jumped 
    straight into using React which was amazing coming from vanilla js and html. It was very easy to start using i really liked the fact
    you're js and html were all right there together. After React we started focusing on the backend. We started learning node js. and express
    using this made the frontend come to live, because before i only knew static code but being able to pull data from a api and into 
    your project was amazing. Then the fun began when we started building our own database we used PostgreSQL and for the ui we used
    dbeaver. We used Heroku to host the server and database. Then the program had up to make a couple of projects from scath using all the 
    tools we leared. I leared all the technologies fairly easy, then we jumped into learing algorthiems this is where i had the hardest
    time becuase it felt like instead of actualy learning it the speed you were suppose to be done with the section they just wanted
    you to memorize it and be done, but if your not going to keep back and looking at that your never going to use it again until 
    an interview and at that point you will have already forgotten it. That was pretty much the sum of my Journey in the bootcamp, but i 
    have to give a huge shotout to my mentor he was with me every step of the way there at every meeting in such a great mode, very knowledgeable 
    always had a answer and the reason why for my question(which i thought was amazing). Alway supportive especially when i got stuck of question 
    and alway just an email away. Honestly out of the Whole course which i am very very grateful for i think the mentor i got is what made 
    the time with thinkful amazing, aslo the pairprogramming we did helped my programing the most.

    After, many months after thinkful i received a job working for a tech company that sold pos(point of sale) systems to dryclearners.
    They interview process was kind of scary the first step was sitting down with the owner and the programmer and that went amazing.
    They told be about the business and the programmer had questions for me i was able to answer all the question, excpet the only one that 
    stands out to me as what is hoisting(moving a function, variable, or class to the top of the scope. So you can use it before it is declared) i wasn't
    able to answer so i asked question right then and there. After this interview i got a phone call from my recuriter while i was still in the parking lot
    and they wanted to set up another interview. So the second interveiew is were things went bad. I sat down with the head IT guy. he had a 
    little test for me to take all about hardware how many ports does this router have, how many address can it have, i have never really 
    messed with any hardware at the time except building a pc. They only question out of the test i was able to get was 
    how do you get your ip address(go to comand line and type ipconfig). The test was pretty much the whole interview so i left feeling
    like i let yet another job oppertuinty go. However i recievce a phone call a few days later saying they really liked you but they
    are neverous to bring you own bored because of the hardware interview, but they lowered the salary some if thats acceptable 
    they want you. Of course i accepted i have been looking for a job for many month i would honelty have taken anthing in the programming 
    field at that point. Working there was great everyone was very firendly and knowledgeable me and the other programmer started build a web based 
    pos system from scarth. Using (Vue, Quasar, Node js, Express, Aws"Cognito, dyanmodb, ", mongodb) at the same time the other programer 
    was makeing a coustomer portal alowing users to chage their information on ther current systems. During that they asked if we 
    could make the customer portal into an app aswell for andriod and apple. So we discussed a few diffrent option, and decided to use
    flutter to make this happen so we only need one codebase using Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. As he finished the wasbased portion i started learning flutter and 
    createing the apps. From there my role was to create and maintain the apps as well as work on the pos system. Unfortenly, due 
    to covid the book of business rapidly decreased and the business ended up being sold. After being there a year and a half i learned 
    many things and glad i recievce all the experience of working on a small team so i was able to be to use so many diffrent 
    technologies that i wouldn't of if i was just doing fontend or a specific role.

    After the comanpy was sold i was laidoff. I started appying for jobs. Received a few interviews, but still no luck. I felt very 
    depressed at the time so i decided i would take a good vacation and relax. So coming back from the vacation.I started working my old job in consturction to pay bills. Still grinding and trying to learn as much as i can and still applying for 
    jobs that seem like would be a good fit. Thats why i started this blog just to have my hands on some kind of code as much as possible. At the time 
    of writing this i still haven't received a job and am actively applying so if anyone is looking for a dedicated worker feel free to message me!
